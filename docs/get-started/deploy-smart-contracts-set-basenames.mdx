description: A guide to help you get started with deploying your smart contracts on Base and setting Basenames for them.
---

Welcome to the Base deployment quickstart guide! This comprehensive walkthrough will help you set up your environment and deploy smart contracts on Base. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide has got you covered.

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this quickstart, you'll be able to:

- Set up your development environment to deploy on Base
- Deploy your smart contracts to Base and set Basenames for them

<Tip>
**Why Base?**

Base is a fast, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain. By following this guide, you'll join a vibrant ecosystem of developers, creators, and innovators who are building a global onchain economy.
</Tip>


## Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-base-project && cd my-base-project
```

2. Install Foundry, a powerful framework for smart contract development

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

This installs Foundry and updates it to the latest version.

3. Initialize a new Solidity project

```bash
forge init
```

Your Foundry project is now ready. You'll find an example contract in the `src` directory, which you can replace with your own contracts. For the purposes of this guide, we'll use the Counter contract provided in `/src/Counter.sol`

<Tip>
Foundry provides a suite of tools for Ethereum application development, including Forge (for testing), Cast (for interacting with the chain), and Anvil (for setting up a local node). You can learn more about Foundry [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
</Tip>


## Configure Foundry with Base

To deploy your smart contracts to Base, you need two key components:

1. A node connection to interact with the Base network
2. A funded private key to deploy the contract

Let's set up both of these:

### 1. Set up your node connection

1. Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory
2. Add the Base network RPC URL to your `.env` file

```bash
BASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.base.org"
```

3. Load your environment variables

```bash
source .env
```

<Tip>
Base Sepolia is the test network for Base, which we will use for the rest of this guide. You can obtain free Base Sepolia ETH from one of the [faucets listed here](/base-chain/tools/network-faucets).
</Tip>


### 2. Secure your private key

1. Store your private key in Foundry's secure keystore

```bash
cast wallet import deployer --interactive
```

2. When prompted enter your private key and a password.

Your private key is stored in `~/.foundry/keystores` which is not tracked by git.

<Warning>
Never share or commit your private key. Always keep it secure and handle with care.
</Warning>


## Setup Your Contract for Naming using Foundry Script

We'll deploy the Counter contract using a Foundry script that will also set a Basename for the contract. First, ensure you have a Basename available to use. You can purchase a Basename from [base.org/names](https://base.org/names) or use a free Basename from the [faucets listed here](/base-chain/tools/network-faucets).

1. Install enscribesol

```bash
forge install enscribexyz/enscribe
```

2. Install openzeppelin

```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

3. Create `remapping.txt` and add the following remappings:

```
enscribe/=lib/enscribe/src/
@openzeppelin/contracts/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/
```

4. Make Counter implement Ownable

Update your `Counter.sol` contract to inherit from `Ownable`:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract Counter is Ownable {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(uint256 initialCount) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        number = initialCount;
    }

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function increment() public {
        number++;
    }
}
```

5. Set a primary name for the contract address in `Counter.s.sol`. We'll use `enscribesol124.abhi.basetest.eth` for this example but you should use your own basename.

Update your deployment script to set a name for the contract:

```solidity
import {Script} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {Counter} from "../src/Counter.sol";
import {Ens} from "enscribe/NameSetter.sol";

contract CounterScript is Script {
    Counter public counter;

    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();

        counter = new Counter(0);
        Ens.setName(block.chainid, address(counter), "enscribesol124.abhi.basetest.eth");

        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

## Deploy Your Contracts

Now that your environment is set up, let's deploy your contracts to Base Sepolia.

1. Use the following command to compile and deploy your contract

```bash
forge script ./src/Counter.s.sol:CounterScript --rpc-url $BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --account deployer
```

2. After successful deployment, the transaction hash will be printed to the console output

### Verify Your Deployment and Basename

To ensure your contract was named successfully:

1. Copy the contract address from the output
2. Navigate to https://app.enscribe.xyz/explore/84532/enscribesol124.abhi.basetest.eth to see the details of the contract we deployed and named.

** You've deployed your smart contracts to Base Sepolia and set Basenames for them!**
